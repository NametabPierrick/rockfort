A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/FadedShadows/pen/pzwCb.

 Made this the other day from some old HTML5 code I found. It can fit to any window and is Responsive in design. Uses the HTML5 Audio tag and displays a beautiful light blue Spectrum EQ analyzer, you change that color too, and you can put any cool wallpaper/background of your choice.

Can't really remember where I found this one... I believe, I Forked it from the FrameLooper Google library or somewhere on stackoverflow.
