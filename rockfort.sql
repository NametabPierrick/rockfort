(41, 'The Weight', 1968, '04:34', 'The Band''s best-known and most enduring recording, "The Weight," is perhaps their most successful attempt at the creation of a new American mythology, a winding, impressionistic story song cut from the rural traditions of roots music -- folk, country, and gospel -- but re-imagined from a distinctly postmodern vantage point. "The Weight"''s writer, Robbie Robertson, once claimed the song was inspired by the work of surrealist filmmaker Luis Buñuel, who did pictures like Viridiana and Nazarin, which explored the "impossibility of sainthood"; however, while the song''s first line -- "I pulled into Nazareth" -- immediately casts a spiritual light, the Nazareth in question is not the birthplace of Christ but rather the Pennsylvania town home to the Martin guitar factory. The landscape shifts similarly throughout, variously suggesting a Deep South setting and a Wild West milieu as well, but wrought throughout with anachronistic quirks which, like the films of Buñuel, together evoke a time and place removed from conventional reality. That said, Robertson''s Nazareth does exist on a spiritual plane -- one of the song''s characters, ol'' Luke, is "waitin'' on the Judgment Day," while another, Carmen, walks with the Devil; the narrator also advises a townswoman to "Go down, Miss Moses/There''s nothin'' you can say" (the overt Biblical implications of the name aside, the lyric also recalls Go Down Moses, a collection of short stories by William Faulkner, himself no slouch in capturing the vagaries of rural culture). Ultimately, "The Weight" of the title appears to concern the mounting burdens and demands of society which no one individual can reasonably shoulder, but even that seems oversimplified; the song operates on far too many levels (musical, narrative, and symbolic) to fit any single interpretation. Given not only the potency of the Band''s original recording (from their classic 1968 debut LP Music From Big Pink) but also its luminously homespun beauty, it''s somewhat surprising to realize what a modern standard "The Weight" has become; though the original only reached number 63 on the pop charts, it became a more substantial hit for other artists, including Jackie DeShannon, Aretha Franklin, and the Supremes with the Temptations. Everyone from Spooky Tooth to the Staple Singers also covered the song, and the Band''s recording also figured prominently in the 1969 Peter Fonda/Dennis Hopper counterculture classic Easy Rider, itself a seminal contribution to the new American folklore as well.', 30, 22),
